# Bank-Churn-Using-KNN 
Customer Churn prediction is predicting which customers are at high risk of leaving your company or canceling a subscription to a service, based on their behavior with your product.For many companies, this is an important prediction. This is because acquiring new customers often costs more than retaining existing ones. Once youâ€™ve identified customers at risk of churn, you need to know exactly what marketing efforts you should make with each customer to maximize their likelihood of staying.
Our model to build will predict bank customer churn in which we use Classification Machine learning models.
The dataset we will use consists of the following features:-
1. RowNumber : row number of the data
2. CustomerId : Bank Id of the customer
3. Surname: Customer's surname
4. CreditScore: the credit score of the customer
5. Geography: location of customer
6. Gender: whether the customer is male or female
7. Age: the age of the customer
